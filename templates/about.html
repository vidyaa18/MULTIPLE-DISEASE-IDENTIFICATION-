                <h4>Diabetes</h4>
                <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.</p>
                <h5>Symptoms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urinating often.</li>
                    <li>Feeling very thirsty.</li>
                    <li>Extreme fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Blurry vision.</li>

                <h4>Liver disease</h4>
                <p>Symptoms of liver disease can vary, but they often include swelling of the abdomen and legs, bruising easily, changes in the color of your stool and urine, and jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes. Sometimes there are no symptoms. Tests such as imaging tests and liver function tests can check for liver damage and help to diagnose liver diseases.</p>

If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later.</p>

                <h4>Pneumonia</h4>
                <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>
